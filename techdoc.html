        Introduction

    <article>
        <p>
            Wisconsin is a state in the upper Midwestern United States. 
            It's the 25th-largest state by total area and the 20th-most populous. 
            It is bordered by Minnesota to the west, Iowa to the southwest, 
            Illinois to the south, Lake Michigan to the east, Michigan to the northeast, 
            and Lake Superior to the north.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wisconsin's geography is diverse, having been greatly impacted by glaciers during the
            Ice Age with the exception of the Driftless Area. The Northern Highland and
            Western Upland along with a part of the Central Plain occupies the western part of
            the state, with lowlands stretching to the shore of Lake Michigan. Wisconsin is third to Ontario
            and Michigan in the length of its Great Lakes coastline. The northern portion of the state is home to the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest.

        Devils Lake
    </header>
    <article>
        <p>Devil's Lake State Park's bluffs are part of the Baraboo Range,
            which scientists believe were formed 1.6 billion years ago,
            making them one of the most ancient rock outcrops in North America.
            The Baraboo Range includes the North Range and South Range of hills,
            which surround a canoe-shaped depression called the Baraboo valley.
            The city of Baraboo is near the center of the valley.
            The north and south ranges meet in the east just west of Interstate Highway 90-94
            and west at Rock Springs, Wisconsin.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final chapter in this fascinating story took place about 15,000 years ago
            when a sheet of ice (the Wisconsin Glacier) crunched into this area.
            The glacier covered the eastern half of the Baraboo Hills with ice but
            not the western half. We know this because its outermost boundary is marked
            by a ridge called a terminal moraine. This ridge consists of rocks and gravel
            dropped by the glacier as it stood and melted along this boundary.
        <p>
            The Wisconsin Glacier rerouted the ancient river(s) elsewhere and deposited
            dams of rocks and earth at the two open ends of the Devil's Lake Gap.
            These dams are part of the terminal moraine. Devil's Lake, therefore,
            is between two glacial "plugs" in an abandoned valley of an ancient river.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there had not been a Wisconsin Glacier, presumably the ancient river(s)
            would still be flowing through the Lower Narrows and Devil's Lake gaps and
            there would not be a Devil's Lake.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lake is spring-fed and varies in depth from 40 to 50 feet. It measures
            500 feet from the lake to the top of the quartzite bluffs.

        <p>
            Pattison State Park is named after Martin Pattison, 
            an early lumber man and miner. In 1879 the company he was working
            with moved to Superior. After becoming wealthy in the iron mining business,
            he purchased an entire city block on the harbor where he built the 42-room
            Martin Pattison House, which is now the Fairlawn Mansion and Museum.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 1917 there was a plan to build a "power dam" on the Black River.
            The dam would have destroyed what is known as the Big Manitou Falls.
            Pattison took the initiative to save the falls by secretly buying land,
            660 acres (270 ha) in total from different land owners along the river.
            In 1918 he donated the land to the state which led to Wisconsin dedicating
            its sixth state park to Martin Pattison on January 20, 1920.
        </p>
        <p>
            Until 1935 Pattison State Park consisted of a small picnic area,
            some wooden overlooks, pit toilets, and a ranger cabin.
            On July 25, 1935 the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)
            began renewing the park. The Corps quarried rock and chiseled
            it into blocks to create the park shelter building, nature center,
            bathhouse, and former office building. It also drained Interfalls Lake,
            rerouted the river channel, hauled sand from Lake Superior's shore to make
            the beach, installed sewer and water systems, removed old roadbeds,
            planted trees, and landscaped and built three miles of foot trails.

        Roche A Cri
    </header>
    <code>The name "Roche-A-Cri" comes from French words meaning "screaming rock."</code>
    <article>
        <p>
            Flat-topped and cliff-sided, Roche-A-Cri Mound is really a rock island
            in what was once Glacial Lake Wisconsin, which covered much of central
            Wisconsin about 15,000 years ago. After the glacial lake disappeared,
            this rocky island, composed of Cambrian sandstone, stood above the
            surrounding countryside.
        </p>
        <p>
            The weathering that helped fashion the Roche-A-Cri Mound continues at
            the edges of the rock. The sandstone slowly breaks and crumbles along
            its joints and outer edges and is blown away. A marker describing the
            park's glacial history can be found on the west side of the mound.
        </p>
        <code>Rock Art</code>
        <p>
        The abundance of rock art suggests that this place had special significance
        to the ancient inhabitants of the region. It is estimated that the petroglyphs
        were carved before A.D. 900, and pictographs appeared only 400-500 years ago.
        The artists are believed to be ancestors of the Ho-Chunk people.
        Interpretive panels present interesting facts, drawings of the art and a
        map to help visitors locate carvings and paints on the mound.

        Rib Mountain

    <code>With an elevation of just under 750ft it's not technically a mountain.</code>
    <article>
        <p>
            The park sits along top a long tall and narrow ridge of quartzite that rises
            from the relatively flat central Wisconsin plain. The quartzite ridge dates
            back to the Penokean orogeny ~1.8 billion years ago, before this the quartzite
            was a large sandstone deposit on the edge of a shallow sea. The volcanic activity
            that resulted from the orogeny metamorphosed the sandstone into the present day
            quartzite. The resulting quartzite is hard and much more resistant to erosion
            than the surrounding rock and over the following millennia the softer surrounding
            rock eroded away revealing the present day ridge.

        Palisade Head
    </header>
    <article>
        <code>Located in Minnesota - Overlooking Lake Superior</code>
        <p>Palisade Head is formed from a rhyolitic lava flow which was extruded some 1.1
            billion years ago. During the Mesoproterozoic era of the Precambrian eon,
            the continent spread apart on the Midcontinent Rift System extending from
            what is now eastern Lake Superior through Duluth to Kansas; this rifting
            process stopped before an ocean developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A flow some 200 feet (60 meters)
            thick formed extremely hard volcanic rock which resisted a billion years of
            erosion which cut down surrounding formations. This formed both Palisade Head
            and Shovel Point, which is within the main part of Tettegouche State Park about
            two miles (three kilometers) to the east. The feature is a shallow headland,
            with Lake Superior to the southwest, southeast, and northeast. Its high point
            is over 300 feet (approximately 100 meters) above the level of the lake; the
            lakeside cliffs stand up to several hundred feet (60 meters) above water level.
